# Clean-Architecture-2
<h1>What is Clean Architecture?</h1>
<br>A software design called "clean architecture" enables us to maintain control over a whole application's code. 
The code/logic, which is unlikely to change, is the clean architecture's primary objective. It must be written independently of any direct dependencies. 
This means that the system's core shouldn't be affected if I wish to change my development framework or User Interface (UI).
Additionally, it implies that we can entirely replace all of our external dependencies.
