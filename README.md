# Clean-Architecture-2
<h1>What is Clean Architecture?</h1>
<br>A software design called "clean architecture" enables us to maintain control over a whole application's code. 
The code/logic, which is unlikely to change, is the clean architecture's primary objective. It must be written independently of any direct dependencies. 
This means that the system's core shouldn't be affected if I wish to change my development framework or User Interface (UI).
Additionally, it implies that we can entirely replace all of our external dependencies.
Here is the illustration of the clean architecture design:
